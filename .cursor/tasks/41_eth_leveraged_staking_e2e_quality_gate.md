# Task 41: ETH Leveraged Staking E2E Quality Gate

## Overview
Validate ETH leveraged staking E2E quality gate by running existing test suite.

## Quality Gate
**Quality Gate Script**: `tests/e2e/test_eth_leveraged_staking_e2e.py`
**Validation**: ETH leveraged staking strategy execution, leveraged staking mechanics, E2E tests
**Status**: âœ… IMPLEMENTED

## Validation Requirements
- Run quality gate script
- Verify all tests pass
- Check ETH leveraged staking strategy execution
- Validate leveraged staking mechanics
- Ensure leverage integration

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Quality gate script executes successfully
- [ ] All ETH leveraged staking E2E tests pass
- [ ] ETH leveraged staking strategy execution validated
- [ ] Leveraged staking mechanics work correctly
- [ ] No regressions introduced

## Reference
- Canonical Spec: `docs/MODES.md` (ETH leveraged staking mode)
- Backend Structure: `core/strategies/eth_leveraged_strategy.py` per TARGET_REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md
- Documentation: `docs/REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md`

## Execution
```bash
# Run the quality gate
python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_eth_leveraged_staking_e2e.py -v

# Verify via run_quality_gates.py
python scripts/run_quality_gates.py --category e2e_strategies
```
