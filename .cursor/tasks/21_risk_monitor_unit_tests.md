# RISK MONITOR UNIT TESTS

## OVERVIEW
This task implements comprehensive unit tests for the Risk Monitor component to validate risk calculations, integration with exposure monitor, and circuit breaker logic. This ensures the Risk Monitor component is fully tested and validated according to specifications.

**Reference**: `docs/specs/03_RISK_MONITOR.md` - Risk Monitor specification  
**Reference**: `docs/REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md` - Section 1 (Reference-Based Architecture)  
**Reference**: `docs/ARCHITECTURAL_DECISION_RECORDS.md` - ADR-003 (Reference-Based Architecture)
