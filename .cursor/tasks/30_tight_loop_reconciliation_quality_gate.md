# Task 30: Tight Loop Reconciliation Quality Gate

## Overview
Validate tight loop reconciliation quality gate by running existing test suite.

## Quality Gate
**Quality Gate Script**: `tests/integration/test_tight_loop_reconciliation.py`
**Validation**: Tight loop reconciliation, sequential chain, reconciliation handshake, integration tests
**Status**: âœ… IMPLEMENTED

## Validation Requirements
- Run quality gate script
- Verify all tests pass
- Check tight loop reconciliation
- Validate sequential chain processing
- Ensure reconciliation handshake

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Quality gate script executes successfully
- [ ] All tight loop reconciliation tests pass
- [ ] Tight loop reconciliation validated
- [ ] Sequential chain processing works correctly
- [ ] No regressions introduced

## Reference
- Canonical Spec: `docs/REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md` Section 3
- Backend Structure: `core/components/`, `core/reconciliation/` per TARGET_REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md
- Documentation: `docs/WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`

## Execution
```bash
# Run the quality gate
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_tight_loop_reconciliation.py -v

# Verify via run_quality_gates.py
python scripts/run_quality_gates.py --category integration_data_flows
```
