# Task 61: ML Directional Strategy Unit Tests

## Overview
Implement comprehensive unit tests for the ML Directional Strategy to ensure proper machine learning-based directional trading functionality with mocked dependencies.

## Reference
- **Component**: `backend/src/basis_strategy_v1/core/strategies/ml_directional_strategy_manager.py`
- **Specification**: `docs/specs/05_STRATEGY_MANAGER.md` (ML Directional Strategy section)
- **Architecture**: `docs/REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md` Section 3

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. ML Directional Strategy Component Testing
- **File**: `tests/unit/test_ml_directional_strategy_unit.py`
- **Scope**: ML directional strategy logic in isolation
- **Dependencies**: Mocked ML data provider, execution interfaces, and ML models

### 2. Test Coverage Requirements
- **Strategy Initialization**: ML directional strategy initializes with ML parameters
- **ML Model Integration**: Machine learning model integration and prediction
- **Directional Logic**: Directional trading based on ML predictions
- **Risk Management**: ML-based risk management and position sizing
- **Model Validation**: ML model validation and performance monitoring
- **Feature Engineering**: Feature extraction and preprocessing

### 3. Mock Strategy
- Use pytest fixtures with mocked ML models and data providers
- Test strategy logic in isolation without external dependencies
- Validate ML predictions and directional trading mechanics

## Quality Gate
**Quality Gate Script**: `tests/unit/test_ml_directional_strategy_unit.py`
**Validation**: ML directional strategy logic, model integration, directional trading
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ PENDING

## Success Criteria
- [ ] ML directional strategy initializes correctly with ML parameters
- [ ] ML model integration processes predictions properly
- [ ] Directional logic executes trades based on ML signals
- [ ] Risk management applies ML-based position sizing
- [ ] Model validation monitors ML model performance
- [ ] Feature engineering extracts relevant market features
