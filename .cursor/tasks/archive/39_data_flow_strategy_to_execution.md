# Task 39: Data Flow Strategy to Execution

## Overview
Implement integration test for Strategy → Execution data flow to validate the data flow from Strategy Manager to Execution Manager per WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md.

## Reference
- **Data Flow**: `docs/WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` (Strategy → Execution section)
- **Components**: Strategy Manager → Execution Manager
- **Architecture**: `docs/REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md` Section 8.4

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Integration Test Implementation
- **File**: `tests/integration/test_data_flow_strategy_to_execution.py`
- **Scope**: Strategy → Execution data flow integration
- **Dependencies**: Real components with minimal real data

### 2. Test Coverage Requirements
- **Data Flow**: Complete data flow from strategy decisions to execution orders
- **Decision Routing**: Strategy decisions are routed correctly to appropriate execution venues
- **Priority Sequencing**: Strategy decision priorities flow correctly to execution sequence
- **Size Validation**: Strategy decision sizes are validated before execution
- **Timing Management**: Strategy timing flows correctly to execution scheduling
- **Risk Controls**: Strategy risk controls flow correctly to execution limits
- **Execution Monitoring**: Strategy decisions are properly monitored during execution
- **Performance**: Performance of strategy to execution data flow
- **Error Handling**: Error handling in strategy to execution data flow
- **Data Validation**: Data validation in strategy to execution data flow

### 3. Integration Strategy
- Use real components with minimal real data
- Test component interactions and data flows
- Validate execution order generation

## Quality Gate
**Quality Gate Script**: `tests/integration/test_data_flow_strategy_to_execution.py`
**Validation**: Strategy → Execution data flow, execution orders, venue routing, integration tests
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Strategy Manager generates strategy decisions correctly
- [ ] Execution Manager processes strategy decisions and generates execution orders
- [ ] Data flow integrity is maintained throughout the process
- [ ] Strategy decisions are routed correctly to appropriate venues
- [ ] Priority sequencing works correctly
- [ ] Size validation works correctly
- [ ] Timing management works correctly
- [ ] Risk controls are enforced in execution limits
- [ ] Execution monitoring works correctly
- [ ] Performance is within acceptable limits
- [ ] Error handling works correctly for invalid strategy decisions
- [ ] Data validation ensures data structure integrity
- [ ] All integration tests pass with 70%+ coverage

## Implementation Notes
- Strategy Manager should generate strategy decisions with proper structure
- Execution Manager should generate execution orders from strategy decisions
- Data flow should maintain integrity and consistency
- Venue routing should work correctly
- Priority sequencing should be accurate
- Size validation should be enforced
- Timing management should work correctly
- Risk controls should be enforced
- Execution monitoring should work correctly
- Performance should be optimized
- Error handling should be robust
- Data validation should ensure proper structure

## Dependencies
