# Task 42: ETH Leveraged Staking E2E

## Overview
Implement E2E test for ETH Leveraged Staking strategy to validate complete ETH leveraged staking strategy execution with real data.

## Reference
- **Strategy**: ETH Leveraged Staking
- **Specification**: `docs/specs/15_EVENT_DRIVEN_STRATEGY_ENGINE.md` (ETH Leveraged Staking section)
- **Architecture**: `docs/REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md` Section 9.2

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. E2E Test Implementation
- **File**: `tests/e2e/test_eth_leveraged_staking_e2e.py`
- **Scope**: Complete ETH leveraged staking strategy execution
- **Dependencies**: Real data provider and full system

### 2. Test Coverage Requirements
- **Strategy Execution**: Complete ETH leveraged staking strategy execution
- **APY Calculation**: ETH leveraged staking APY calculation accuracy
- **Risk Management**: ETH leveraged staking risk management
- **Hedging Mechanism**: ETH leveraged staking hedging mechanism
- **Liquidation Protection**: ETH leveraged staking liquidation protection
- **Rewards Optimization**: ETH leveraged staking rewards optimization
- **Performance Metrics**: ETH leveraged staking performance metrics
- **Error Handling**: ETH leveraged staking error handling
- **Data Validation**: ETH leveraged staking data validation

### 3. E2E Strategy
- Use real data and full system
- Test complete strategy execution
- Validate strategy performance and results

## Quality Gate
**Quality Gate Script**: `tests/e2e/test_eth_leveraged_staking_e2e.py`
**Validation**: ETH leveraged staking strategy execution, APY calculation, risk management, E2E tests
**Status**: âœ… IMPLEMENTED

## Success Criteria
- [ ] ETH leveraged staking strategy executes correctly
- [ ] APY calculation is accurate (5-15% range for leveraged staking)
- [ ] Risk management works correctly
- [ ] Hedging mechanism works correctly
- [ ] Liquidation protection works correctly
- [ ] Rewards optimization works correctly
- [ ] Performance metrics are calculated correctly
- [ ] Error handling works correctly
- [ ] Data validation ensures proper structure
