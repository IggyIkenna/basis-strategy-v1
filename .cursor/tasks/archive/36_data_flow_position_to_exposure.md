# Task 36: Data Flow Position to Exposure

## Overview
Implement integration test for Position → Exposure data flow to validate the data flow from Position Monitor to Exposure Monitor per WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md.

## Reference
- **Data Flow**: `docs/WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` (Position → Exposure section)
- **Components**: Position Monitor → Exposure Monitor
- **Architecture**: `docs/REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md` Section 8.1

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Integration Test Implementation
- **File**: `tests/integration/test_data_flow_position_to_exposure.py`
- **Scope**: Position → Exposure data flow integration
- **Dependencies**: Real components with minimal real data

### 2. Test Coverage Requirements
- **Data Flow**: Complete data flow from position collection to exposure calculation
- **State Persistence**: Position state persistence flows correctly to exposure calculations
- **Venue Aggregation**: Position venue aggregation flows correctly to exposure venue breakdown
- **Asset Filtering**: Position asset filtering flows correctly to exposure asset filtering
- **Timestamp Flow**: Position timestamps flow correctly to exposure timestamps
- **Error Handling**: Position errors are handled correctly in exposure calculations
- **Data Validation**: Position data validation flows correctly to exposure validation
- **Performance**: Performance of position to exposure data flow

### 3. Integration Strategy
- Use real components with minimal real data
- Test component interactions and data flows
- Validate data integrity throughout the flow

## Quality Gate
**Quality Gate Script**: `tests/integration/test_data_flow_position_to_exposure.py`
**Validation**: Position → Exposure data flow, state persistence, venue aggregation, integration tests
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Position Monitor collects positions correctly
- [ ] Exposure Monitor processes positions and calculates exposures
- [ ] Data flow integrity is maintained throughout the process
- [ ] Position state persistence flows correctly to exposure calculations
- [ ] Venue aggregation works correctly in exposure calculations
- [ ] Asset filtering works correctly in exposure calculations
- [ ] Timestamps are consistent throughout the data flow
- [ ] Error handling works correctly for invalid positions
- [ ] Data validation ensures data structure integrity
- [ ] Performance is within acceptable limits
- [ ] All integration tests pass with 70%+ coverage

## Implementation Notes
- Position Monitor should collect positions with proper structure
- Exposure Monitor should calculate exposures from positions
- Data flow should maintain integrity and consistency
- State persistence should work correctly
- Venue aggregation should be accurate
- Asset filtering should work as expected
- Timestamps should be consistent and recent
- Error handling should be robust
- Data validation should ensure proper structure
- Performance should be optimized
