# Task 37: Data Flow Exposure to Risk

## Overview
Implement integration test for Exposure → Risk data flow to validate the data flow from Exposure Monitor to Risk Monitor per WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md.

## Reference
- **Data Flow**: `docs/WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` (Exposure → Risk section)
- **Components**: Exposure Monitor → Risk Monitor
- **Architecture**: `docs/REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md` Section 8.2

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Integration Test Implementation
- **File**: `tests/integration/test_data_flow_exposure_to_risk.py`
- **Scope**: Exposure → Risk data flow integration
- **Dependencies**: Real components with minimal real data

### 2. Test Coverage Requirements
- **Data Flow**: Complete data flow from exposure calculation to risk assessment
- **Exposure Aggregation**: Exposure aggregation flows correctly to risk calculations
- **Venue Risk Breakdown**: Exposure venue breakdown flows correctly to venue risk analysis
- **Correlation Risk**: Exposure correlations flow correctly to correlation risk calculations
- **Risk Limits**: Exposure limits flow correctly to risk breach detection
- **Historical Risk**: Historical exposure data flows correctly to risk metrics calculation
- **Stress Testing**: Exposure stress testing flows correctly to stress risk scenarios
- **Performance**: Performance of exposure to risk data flow
- **Error Handling**: Error handling in exposure to risk data flow
- **Data Validation**: Data validation in exposure to risk data flow

### 3. Integration Strategy
- Use real components with minimal real data
- Test component interactions and data flows
- Validate risk calculations and aggregations

## Quality Gate
**Quality Gate Script**: `tests/integration/test_data_flow_exposure_to_risk.py`
**Validation**: Exposure → Risk data flow, risk aggregation, correlation analysis, integration tests
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
