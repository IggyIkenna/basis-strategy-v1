# Task 49: Health Routes Unit Tests

## Overview
Implement comprehensive unit tests for the Health Routes API endpoints to ensure proper health monitoring functionality with mocked dependencies.

## Reference
- **Component**: `backend/src/basis_strategy_v1/api/routes/health.py`
- **Specification**: `docs/specs/12_FRONTEND_SPEC.md` (Health Monitoring section)
- **Architecture**: `docs/REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md` Section 6.2

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Health Routes Component Testing
- **File**: `tests/unit/test_health_routes_unit.py`
- **Scope**: Health monitoring API endpoints in isolation
- **Dependencies**: Mocked health service and dependencies

### 2. Test Coverage Requirements
- **Health Check**: GET /health with basic health status
- **Detailed Health**: GET /health/detailed with component health status
- **Component Health**: GET /health/component/{name} with specific component health
- **Health History**: GET /health/history with health status history
- **Health Metrics**: GET /health/metrics with performance metrics
- **Health Alerts**: GET /health/alerts with active health alerts

### 3. Mock Strategy
- Use pytest fixtures with mocked health service
- Test API endpoints in isolation without external dependencies
- Validate request/response formats and health status structure

## Quality Gate
**Quality Gate Script**: `tests/unit/test_health_routes_unit.py`
**Validation**: Health endpoints, component monitoring, alert system
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ PENDING

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Health routes initialize correctly with mocked dependencies
- [ ] Health check returns basic system status
- [ ] Detailed health returns component-level status
- [ ] Component health returns specific component status
- [ ] Health history provides status change tracking
- [ ] Health metrics return performance indicators
- [ ] Health alerts identify system issues

## Estimated Time
4-6 hours
