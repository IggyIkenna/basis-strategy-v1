# Task 33: Results Store Unit Tests

## Overview
Implement comprehensive unit tests for the Results Store component to ensure proper results storage functionality with mocked dependencies.

## Reference
- **Component**: `backend/src/basis_strategy_v1/infrastructure/storage/results_store.py`
- **Specification**: `docs/specs/17_HEALTH_ERROR_SYSTEMS.md` (Results Storage section)
- **Architecture**: `docs/REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md` Section 6.3

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Results Store Component Testing
- **File**: `tests/unit/test_results_store_unit.py`
- **Scope**: Results storage functionality in isolation
- **Dependencies**: Mocked config and data provider

### 2. Test Coverage Requirements
- **Initialization**: Results store initializes correctly with config and data provider
- **Backtest Results**: Storing backtest results with proper serialization
- **Results Retrieval**: Retrieving backtest results by ID
- **Live Trading Results**: Storing live trading results with real-time data
- **Results Listing**: Listing available results with filtering
- **Results Deletion**: Deleting results by ID
- **CSV Export**: Exporting results to CSV format

### 3. Mock Strategy
- Use pytest fixtures with mocked config and data provider
- Test component in isolation without external dependencies
- Validate data serialization and storage operations

## Quality Gate
**Quality Gate Script**: `tests/unit/test_results_store_unit.py`
**Validation**: Results storage functionality, serialization, retrieval, unit tests
**Status**: âœ… IMPLEMENTED

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Results store initializes correctly with mocked dependencies
- [ ] Backtest results are stored with proper JSON serialization
- [ ] Results can be retrieved by ID with correct data structure
- [ ] Live trading results are stored with real-time timestamps
- [ ] Available results can be listed with filtering options
- [ ] Results can be deleted by ID
- [ ] Results can be exported to CSV format
- [ ] All unit tests pass with 80%+ coverage
- [ ] Component works in isolation with mocked dependencies

## Implementation Notes
- Results should be stored in JSON format with proper serialization
- Live trading results should include real-time timestamps
- Results listing should support filtering by strategy mode
- CSV export should include proper headers and data formatting
- Error handling should be robust for file operations
- Results should be organized by strategy mode and date

## Dependencies
- Results Store component implementation
- Pytest testing framework
- Mock objects for dependencies
- File system operations (mocked)
