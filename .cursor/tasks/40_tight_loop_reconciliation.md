# Task 40: Tight Loop Reconciliation

## Overview
Implement integration test for Tight Loop Reconciliation to validate the tight loop architecture per ADR-001 with sequential processing and reconciliation.

## Reference
- **Architecture**: `docs/REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md` Section 8.5
- **ADR**: ADR-001 (Tight Loop Architecture)
- **Components**: Position Monitor → Exposure Monitor → Risk Monitor → Strategy Manager → Execution Manager

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Integration Test Implementation
- **File**: `tests/integration/test_tight_loop_reconciliation.py`
- **Scope**: Tight loop architecture integration
- **Dependencies**: Real components with minimal real data

### 2. Test Coverage Requirements
- **Sequential Processing**: Tight loop processes components in correct sequential order
- **Reconciliation Handshake**: Reconciliation handshake between components in tight loop
- **Data Consistency**: Data consistency throughout tight loop processing
- **Error Propagation**: Error propagation and handling in tight loop
- **Performance Requirements**: Tight loop meets performance requirements
- **State Persistence**: State persistence throughout tight loop processing
- **Concurrent Safety**: Tight loop is safe for concurrent execution
- **Rollback Capability**: Tight loop rollback capability in case of failures

### 3. Integration Strategy
- Use real components with minimal real data
- Test complete tight loop execution
- Validate sequential processing and reconciliation

## Quality Gate
**Quality Gate Script**: `tests/integration/test_tight_loop_reconciliation.py`
**Validation**: Tight loop architecture, sequential processing, reconciliation, integration tests
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
