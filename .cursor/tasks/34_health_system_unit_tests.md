# Task 34: Health System Unit Tests

## Overview
Implement comprehensive unit tests for the Health System component to ensure proper health monitoring functionality with mocked dependencies.

## Reference
- **Component**: `backend/src/basis_strategy_v1/infrastructure/health/health_system.py`
- **Specification**: `docs/specs/17_HEALTH_ERROR_SYSTEMS.md` (Health Monitoring section)
- **Architecture**: `docs/REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md` Section 6.4

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Health System Component Testing
- **File**: `tests/unit/test_health_system_unit.py`
- **Scope**: Health monitoring functionality in isolation
- **Dependencies**: Mocked config and data provider

### 2. Test Coverage Requirements
- **Initialization**: Health system initializes correctly with config and data provider
- **Component Registration**: Registering components for health monitoring
- **Overall Health Status**: Getting overall system health status
- **Detailed Health Status**: Getting detailed health status for all components
- **Error Handling**: Handling component health check failures
- **Health Metrics**: Collecting health metrics from components
- **Status Caching**: Health status caching to avoid excessive checks
- **Alert Thresholds**: Health alert thresholds and notifications

### 3. Mock Strategy
- Use pytest fixtures with mocked config and data provider
- Test component in isolation without external dependencies
- Validate health status aggregation and reporting

## Quality Gate
**Quality Gate Script**: `tests/unit/test_health_system_unit.py`
**Validation**: Health monitoring functionality, status aggregation, alerting, unit tests
**Status**: âœ… IMPLEMENTED

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Health system initializes correctly with mocked dependencies
- [ ] Components can be registered for health monitoring
- [ ] Overall health status is calculated correctly
- [ ] Detailed health status includes all component information
- [ ] Health check failures are handled gracefully
- [ ] Health metrics are collected from all components
- [ ] Status caching works to avoid excessive checks
- [ ] Alert thresholds trigger notifications correctly
- [ ] All unit tests pass with 80%+ coverage
- [ ] Component works in isolation with mocked dependencies

## Implementation Notes
- Health system should aggregate status from all registered components
- Components should implement health_check() method
- Health status should include uptime, memory usage, and other metrics
- Alert thresholds should be configurable
- Status caching should have configurable duration
- Error handling should be robust for component failures
- Health metrics should include CPU, memory, disk, and network usage

## Dependencies
- Health System component implementation
- Pytest testing framework
- Mock objects for dependencies
- Component health check interfaces
