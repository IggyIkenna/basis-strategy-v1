# Task 29: Data Flow Strategy→Execution Quality Gate

## Overview
Validate data flow strategy to execution quality gate by running existing test suite.

## Quality Gate
**Quality Gate Script**: `tests/integration/test_data_flow_strategy_to_execution.py`
**Validation**: Strategy→Execution data flow, execution instructions, integration tests
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## Validation Requirements
- Run quality gate script
- Verify all tests pass
- Check strategy to execution data flow
- Validate execution instructions
- Ensure execution coordination

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Quality gate script executes successfully
- [ ] All data flow strategy→execution tests pass
- [ ] Strategy to execution data flow validated
- [ ] Execution instructions work correctly
- [ ] No regressions introduced

## Reference
- Canonical Spec: `docs/WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` (Strategy→Execution section)
- Backend Structure: `core/strategies/`, `core/execution/` per TARGET_REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md
- Documentation: `docs/REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md` Section 8.1

## Execution
```bash
# Run the quality gate
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_data_flow_strategy_to_execution.py -v

# Verify via run_quality_gates.py
python scripts/run_quality_gates.py --category integration_data_flows
```
