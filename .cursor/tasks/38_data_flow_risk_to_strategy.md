# Task 38: Data Flow Risk to Strategy

## Overview
Implement integration test for Risk → Strategy data flow to validate the data flow from Risk Monitor to Strategy Manager per WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md.

## Reference
- **Data Flow**: `docs/WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` (Risk → Strategy section)
- **Components**: Risk Monitor → Strategy Manager
- **Architecture**: `docs/REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md` Section 8.3

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Integration Test Implementation
- **File**: `tests/integration/test_data_flow_risk_to_strategy.py`
- **Scope**: Risk → Strategy data flow integration
- **Dependencies**: Real components with minimal real data

### 2. Test Coverage Requirements
- **Data Flow**: Complete data flow from risk assessment to strategy decisions
- **Risk Breach Handling**: Risk breaches trigger appropriate strategy adjustments
- **Risk Limits**: Risk limits flow correctly to strategy constraints
- **Correlation Analysis**: Risk correlations flow correctly to strategy diversification decisions
- **Volatility Analysis**: Risk volatility flows correctly to strategy timing decisions
- **Stress Scenarios**: Risk stress scenarios flow correctly to strategy contingency planning
- **Historical Learning**: Historical risk data flows correctly to strategy learning
- **Performance**: Performance of risk to strategy data flow
- **Error Handling**: Error handling in risk to strategy data flow
- **Data Validation**: Data validation in risk to strategy data flow

### 3. Integration Strategy
- Use real components with minimal real data
- Test component interactions and data flows
- Validate strategy decision generation

## Quality Gate
**Quality Gate Script**: `tests/integration/test_data_flow_risk_to_strategy.py`
**Validation**: Risk → Strategy data flow, strategy decisions, risk constraints, integration tests
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Risk Monitor calculates risk metrics correctly
- [ ] Strategy Manager processes risk metrics and generates strategy decisions
- [ ] Data flow integrity is maintained throughout the process
- [ ] Risk breaches trigger appropriate strategy adjustments
- [ ] Risk limits are enforced in strategy constraints
- [ ] Correlation analysis drives diversification decisions
- [ ] Volatility analysis drives timing decisions
- [ ] Stress scenarios drive contingency planning
- [ ] Historical risk data drives strategy learning
- [ ] Performance is within acceptable limits
- [ ] Error handling works correctly for invalid risk data
- [ ] Data validation ensures data structure integrity
- [ ] All integration tests pass with 70%+ coverage

## Implementation Notes
- Risk Monitor should calculate risk metrics with proper structure
- Strategy Manager should generate strategy decisions from risk metrics
- Data flow should maintain integrity and consistency
- Risk breaches should trigger appropriate adjustments
- Risk limits should be enforced correctly
- Correlation analysis should drive diversification
- Volatility analysis should drive timing
- Stress scenarios should drive contingency planning
- Historical data should drive learning
- Performance should be optimized
- Error handling should be robust
- Data validation should ensure proper structure
