# Documentation Specs Implementation Status Agent Instructions

## Mission
Add comprehensive "Current Implementation Status" sections to all files in `docs/specs/` based on the actual state of the codebase versus canonical architectural principles and task requirements.

## Primary Objectives

### 1. Implementation Status Analysis
- Analyze each component's current implementation state
- Identify architecture compliance violations
- Document TODO items and refactoring needs
- Assess quality gate status
- Map task completion status

### 2. Spec Structure Enhancement
- Add standardized "Current Implementation Status" section to each spec
- Include architecture compliance status
- Document specific TODO items from codebase
- Reference relevant .cursor/tasks/ items
- Provide quality gate status

### 3. Canonical Alignment
- Ensure all status sections align with canonical architectural principles
- Reference specific task requirements from .cursor/tasks/
- Map implementation gaps to specific refactoring tasks
- Validate against quality gate requirements

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Component Analysis

   - Consistent bullet point formatting
   - Proper cross-references to other docs

3. **Validate Content Quality**:
