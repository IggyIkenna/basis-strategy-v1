# Docs Logical Inconsistency Agent System

## Overview

Create two new agents that work together to identify and resolve logical inconsistencies across all documentation through exhaustive cross-referencing.

## Agent 1: Docs Logical Inconsistency Detection Agent

### Files to Create

1. **`.cursor/docs-logical-inconsistency-agent.json`** - Agent configuration
2. **`.cursor/docs-logical-inconsistency-instructions.md`** - Implementation instructions for agent
3. **`.cursor/docs-logical-inconsistency-web-prompt.md`** - Web browser prompt for background execution

### Agent Configuration Structure

Based on existing patterns from `docs-consistency-agent.json` and `docs-specs-implementation-status-agent.json`:

- `agent_name`: "Docs Logical Inconsistency Detection Agent"
- `background_mode`: true
- `web_browser_mode`: true
- `focus_areas`: ["docs/", "docs/specs/", ".cursor/tasks/"]
- `context_files`: All canonical docs (REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md, REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md, etc.)
- `primary_mission`: "Identify logical inconsistencies across all documentation through exhaustive cross-referencing of every doc to every other doc"

### Detection Capabilities

**Semantic Analysis:**

- Cross-reference same concepts with different descriptions
- Detect contradictory architectural principles
- Find conflicting configuration requirements
- Identify opposing API specifications
- Spot incompatible quality gate criteria

**Structural Analysis:**

- Inconsistent terminology for same concepts
- Different data structure definitions
- Conflicting component responsibilities
- Divergent workflow descriptions
- Mismatched testing requirements

### Report Generation

Output format: `DOCS_LOGICAL_INCONSISTENCY_REPORT_[timestamp].md`

Report structure:

```markdown
# Logical Inconsistency Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
- Total docs analyzed: X
- Inconsistencies found: Y
- Critical conflicts: Z
- Consistency score: X%

## Critical Inconsistencies (MUST FIX)
[Doc A] vs [Doc B]:
- **Concept**: [What concept has conflict]
- **Doc A Statement** (Line X): [Exact quote]
- **Doc B Statement** (Line Y): [Exact quote]
- **Conflict Type**: [Semantic/Structural]
- **Canonical Source**: [Which is authoritative]
- **Prescribed Resolution**: [Specific fix with priority to canonical]
- **Priority**: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW

## Matrix Analysis
[Cross-reference matrix showing all doc pairs checked]
```

### Cross-Referencing Strategy

**Exhaustive approach:**

1. Load all docs in memory (docs/*.md + docs/specs/*.md = ~35 files)
2. For each doc pair (A, B):

   - Extract key concepts, terms, principles from both
   - Compare statements about same concepts
   - Detect contradictions using semantic similarity
   - Flag structural inconsistencies

3. Generate conflict matrix showing all relationships
4. Prioritize by canonical source hierarchy:

   - REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md (highest)
   - REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md
   - Component specs
   - Other docs

### Prescriptive Resolution Logic

- Always prioritize canonical sources as correct
- Suggest updating non-canonical to match canonical
- Provide exact line references for changes
- Include severity assessment
- Suggest consolidation where duplicate info exists

## Agent 2: Docs Inconsistency Resolution Agent

### Files to Create

1. **`.cursor/docs-inconsistency-resolution-agent.json`** - Agent configuration
2. **`.cursor/docs-inconsistency-resolution-instructions.md`** - Implementation instructions
3. **`.cursor/docs-inconsistency-resolution-web-prompt.md`** - Web browser prompt

### Agent Configuration

- `agent_name`: "Docs Inconsistency Resolution Agent"
- `background_mode`: true
- `web_browser_mode`: true
- `input_file`: "DOCS_LOGICAL_INCONSISTENCY_REPORT_[timestamp].md"
- `primary_mission`: "Read inconsistency report and apply approved fixes to resolve documented conflicts"

### Resolution Capabilities

**Report Processing:**

- Parse inconsistency report structure
- Extract approved fixes (marked by user)
- Validate resolution prescriptions
- Apply fixes in priority order

**Fix Application:**

- Update non-canonical docs to match canonical sources
- Replace contradictory statements
- Standardize terminology
- Consolidate duplicate information
- Preserve context and formatting

**Validation:**

- Verify fixes don't create new conflicts
- Ensure all approved items resolved
- Generate completion report
- Run quality gates if available

### Workflow Integration

1. User runs Detection Agent â†’ generates report
2. User reviews report, marks approved fixes
3. User runs Resolution Agent with approved report
4. Agent applies all approved fixes
5. Agent generates completion summary

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Detection Agent Files

Create three files with detection agent configuration, instructions, and web prompt following existing patterns.

### Step 2: Create Resolution Agent Files  

Create three files with resolution agent configuration, instructions, and web prompt for fix application.

### Step 3: Integration

Ensure agents reference each other appropriately and can be chained together in workflow.

### Step 4: Validation

Test with small doc subset to ensure detection and resolution work correctly.

## Key Design Decisions

**Why Exhaustive Cross-Referencing:**

- Ensures no conflicts missed
- Creates comprehensive conflict matrix
- Provides full visibility into doc relationships

**Why Prescriptive Reports:**

- Reduces manual decision-making
- Leverages canonical source hierarchy
- Provides actionable resolution steps

**Why Separate Agents:**

- Allows manual review between detection and fixing
- Prevents automatic incorrect changes
- Gives user control over resolution

**Canonical Source Priority:**

1. REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md
2. REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md  
3. VENUE_ARCHITECTURE.md
4. Component specs (docs/specs/)
5. Guide docs (WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md, USER_GUIDE.md, etc.)
6. Task files (.cursor/tasks/)

## Success Criteria

### Detection Agent Success

- All 35 docs cross-referenced against each other
- Report generated with all inconsistencies found
- Each conflict has prescriptive resolution
- Canonical sources properly prioritized
- Matrix shows complete coverage

### Resolution Agent Success

- All approved fixes applied correctly
- No new conflicts introduced
- Completion report generated
- Documentation consistency improved
- Quality gates pass (if applicable)

### Overall Success

- `.cursor/docs-logical-inconsistency-agent.json` created
- `.cursor/docs-logical-inconsistency-instructions.md` created
- `.cursor/docs-logical-inconsistency-web-prompt.md` created
- `.cursor/docs-inconsistency-resolution-agent.json` created
- `.cursor/docs-inconsistency-resolution-instructions.md` created
- `.cursor/docs-inconsistency-resolution-web-prompt.md` created
- All files follow existing agent patterns
- Agents can be executed independently
- Workflow documented in instructions
