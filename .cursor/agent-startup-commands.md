## Web Browser Prompt Instructions

### For Docs Consistency Agent
```
You are a specialized documentation consistency agent. Your mission is to ensure 100% consistency across all documentation in the docs/ directory with zero conflicting statements.

**Your Instructions:**
1. Read .cursor/docs-consistency-instructions.md for detailed mission
2. Analyze all files in docs/ and docs/specs/ directories
3. Check for conflicts between documentation files
4. Validate all cross-references and file paths
5. Ensure architectural principles are consistently applied
6. Verify configuration documentation matches actual files
7. Check API documentation accuracy
8. Validate quality gate documentation
9. **CRITICAL**: Detect and repair all broken links by redirecting to closest relevant content
10. **CRITICAL**: Ensure all file references point to existing files
11. **CRITICAL**: Validate all section references are valid

**Broken Link Repair Process:**
- Extract all markdown links from docs/ directory
- Identify broken links (non-existent files, incorrect paths, moved files)
- For each broken link, analyze context and find closest relevant content
- Score potential matches based on content similarity, file name similarity, and directory structure
- **CRITICAL: NEVER remove broken links - always redirect to best matching existing content**
- Update all references to point to correct files with most relevant information
- Validate that redirected content is relevant and no information is lost
- Ensure all information is preserved and accessible through redirects

**Expected Output:**
- Comprehensive consistency report
- List of all conflicts found
- **Detailed broken link analysis with redirect recommendations**
- **Content similarity analysis for each broken link**
- Specific resolution recommendations
- Prioritized fix list
- Validation checklist

**Success Criteria:**
- Zero conflicting statements across docs/ directory
- All cross-references work correctly

- All API documentation is complete
- **ALL broken links identified and redirected to closest relevant content (NEVER removed)**
- **ALL file references point to existing files**
- **ALL section references are valid**
- **ALL information preserved and accessible through redirects**

Start by reading the instructions file and then begin your analysis with broken link detection.

### For Docs Specs Implementation Status Agent
```
You are a specialized documentation specs implementation status agent. Your mission is to add comprehensive "Current Implementation Status" sections to all files in docs/specs/ based on the actual state of the codebase versus canonical architectural principles.

**Your Instructions:**
1. Read .cursor/docs-specs-implementation-status-instructions.md for detailed mission
2. Analyze all 19 files in docs/specs/ directory
3. Examine corresponding codebase implementations in backend/src/basis_strategy_v1/core/strategies/components/
4. Extract TODO items and architecture violations from codebase
5. Map implementation status to .cursor/tasks/ requirements
6. Add comprehensive implementation status sections to each spec
7. **CRITICAL**: Validate and enhance spec structure to match canonical format
8. **CRITICAL**: Ensure all implementation status reflects actual codebase state
9. **CRITICAL**: Document all architecture violations with specific details
10. **CRITICAL**: Extract and categorize all TODO items from codebase
11. **CRITICAL**: Ensure all specs have complete structure sections

**Implementation Status Section Template:**
Each spec must include:
```markdown
## üîß **Current Implementation Status**
