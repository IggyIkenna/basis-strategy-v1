# ETH Leveraged Staking Mode Configuration
# ETH leveraged (borrowing to stake) staking with LST rewards (staking rewards + seasonal bonuses in ETHFI and EIGEN wrapped up as KING tokens)
# No hedge as ETH share class. we only leverage the staking spread not the overall eth deltas which we keep neutral outside initial + pnl
