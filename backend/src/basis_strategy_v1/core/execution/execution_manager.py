Execution Manager Component

TODO-IMPLEMENT: MISSING CRITICAL COMPONENT - 19_venue_based_execution_architecture.md
ISSUE: This component is completely missing and is critical for the architecture:

1. MISSING EXECUTION MANAGER:
   - Strategy manager cannot properly route instructions to venues
   - No centralized venue-based instruction routing
   - No execution type interface coordination
   - No environment-specific credential routing

2. REQUIRED ARCHITECTURE (per 19_venue_based_execution_architecture.md):
   - Centralized ExecutionManager routes requests to execution type interfaces (wallet vs trade)
   - Execution type interfaces direct to venue client implementations
   - Backtest mode: Simulation for venue interactions (dummy calls, no waiting)
   - Live mode: Different endpoints using env variable credentials
   - **Reference**: .cursor/tasks/19_venue_based_execution_architecture.md (canonical: docs/VENUE_ARCHITECTURE.md)

3. REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATION:
   ```python
   class ExecutionManager:
       """Centralized execution manager for venue-based instruction routing."""
       
       def __init__(self, execution_mode: str, config: Dict[str, Any]):
           self.execution_mode = execution_mode
           self.config = config
           self.execution_interfaces = {}  # wallet, trade, etc.
           self._initialize_execution_interfaces()
       
       def _initialize_execution_interfaces(self):
           """Initialize execution type interfaces (wallet, trade, etc.)."""
           # Create execution interfaces that handle different instruction types
           # Each interface routes to appropriate venue client implementations
       
       async def route_instruction(self, instruction_type: str, instruction: Dict, market_data: Dict) -> Dict:
           """Route instruction to appropriate execution type interface."""
           # Route to execution type interface (wallet_transfer, cex_trade, smart_contract)
           # Each interface handles venue client routing and credential management
   ```

4. EXECUTION TYPE INTERFACE ROUTING:
   - wallet_transfer -> TransferExecutionInterface
   - cex_trade -> CEXExecutionInterface  
   - smart_contract -> OnChainExecutionInterface
   - Each interface handles venue client routing and credential management

5. ENVIRONMENT INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
   - Route to appropriate environment-specific credentials based on BASIS_ENVIRONMENT
   - Backtest mode: Execution interfaces exist for CODE ALIGNMENT only - NO credentials needed, NO heartbeat tests
   - Backtest mode: Data source (CSV vs DB) is handled by DATA PROVIDER, not venue execution manager
   - Live mode: Handle testnet vs production endpoint routing and heartbeat tests
   - BASIS_DEPLOYMENT_MODE is NOT for venue routing - it's for port/host forwarding and dependency injection

CURRENT STATE: This component needs to be implemented from scratch.
