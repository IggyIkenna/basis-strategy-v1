# TODO-REFACTOR: MISSING SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATIONS - See docs/REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md
# ISSUE: Multiple critical system implementations are missing from the codebase
# Canonical: docs/REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md
# Fix: Implement all missing systems according to task specifications
# Status: PENDING

## Missing System Implementations:

### 1. Centralized Utility Manager (Task 15)
- File: backend/src/basis_strategy_v1/core/utilities/utility_manager.py
- Reference: docs/REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE_CANONICAL.md - Mode-Specific PnL Monitor
- Purpose: Centralize all utility methods (liquidity index, market prices, conversions)
- Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### 2. Equity Tracking System (Equity Tracking Task)
- File: backend/src/basis_strategy_v1/core/math/equity_calculator.py
- Reference: docs/specs/04_pnl_monitor.md - Equity Tracking
- Purpose: Track equity across all venues in share class currency
- Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### 3. Dust Management System (Dust Management Task)
- File: Strategy instances now handle sell_dust action directly
- Reference: Strategy-specific dust handling
- Purpose: Strategy instances decide on sell_dust action and convert to orders
- Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Strategy-based approach)

### 4. Reserve Management System (Reserve Management Task)
- File: Not implemented - removed from scope
- Reference: Not applicable
- Purpose: Reserve management not needed at this time
- Status: ❌ REMOVED FROM SCOPE

### 5. Venue Factory (Task 19)
- File: backend/src/basis_strategy_v1/core/venues/venue_factory.py
- Reference: docs/VENUE_ARCHITECTURE.md - Venue-Based Execution
- Purpose: Create venue clients based on strategy requirements
- Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED

### 6. BaseStrategyManager Refactor (Strategy Manager Refactor Task)
- File: backend/src/basis_strategy_v1/core/strategies/base_strategy_manager.py
- Reference: docs/specs/05_STRATEGY_MANAGER.md - Strategy Manager Refactor
- Purpose: Inheritance-based strategy modes with standardized wrapper actions
- Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### 7. Duplicate Risk Monitor Consolidation (Task 21)
- File: Only one risk_monitor.py exists in core/components/
- Reference: docs/specs/03_RISK_MONITOR.md - Consolidate Duplicate Risk Monitors
- Purpose: No duplicate risk monitor found - only one implementation exists
- Status: ✅ VERIFIED (No duplicates found)

### 8. Transfer Manager Removal (Strategy Manager Refactor Task)
- File: transfer_manager.py not found - already removed
- Reference: docs/specs/05_STRATEGY_MANAGER.md - Strategy Manager Refactor
- Purpose: Transfer manager already removed from codebase
- Status: ✅ VERIFIED (File not found - already removed)

## Implementation Priority:
1. Remove duplicate files (Tasks 21, Strategy Manager Refactor)
2. Implement centralized utility manager (Task 15)
3. Implement venue factory (Task 19)
4. Implement equity tracking system
5. Implement dust management system
6. Implement reserve management system
7. Implement BaseStrategyManager refactor
