Excellent question — this touches on how **atomic transactions** and **flash loans** work at the EVM level, especially when chaining protocols like **Morpho** (which wraps Aave/Compound liquidity) and **Ether.Fi or Lido** (for staking).

Let’s break it down step-by-step 👇

---

### ⚙️ 1. The atomic transaction structure

An **atomic transaction** (in DeFi terms) is a **single on-chain transaction** that executes multiple smart-contract calls in sequence.
All internal operations either **succeed together** or **revert together**.
So the “flash loan” step, “stake” step, and “repay” step all happen **within the same block and tx**.

Example structure:

```solidity
FlashLoan → Use funds (stake, swap, etc.) → Repay flash loan
```

---

### 🏦 2. The flash loan fund flow

When you call Morpho’s flash-loan function (or Aave’s directly), the protocol **transfers the borrowed WETH to the receiver contract** you specify.
That receiver is usually **your custom smart contract** — not your EOA wallet.

So:

* The funds **do not have to hit your wallet**.
* They are sent from the liquidity pool → to your contract’s address → your contract executes whatever actions you coded → and then repays the loan by the end of the same transaction.

---

### 💧 3. Example flow in your case (Morpho → Ether.Fi / Lido)

Let’s say you want to **borrow WETH**, **stake it**, and **repay the flash loan** atomically.

Here’s what happens inside your **flash-loan executor contract**:

1. **Morpho flash loan** transfers WETH to your executor contract.

2. Inside the same function:

   ```solidity
   // Your contract has WETH now
   WETH.approve(lido, amount);
   lido.submit{value: amount}(address(this));
   ```

   or if using Ether.Fi:

   ```solidity
   WETH.approve(etherFi, amount);
   etherFi.deposit(amount);
   ```

   → Ether.Fi / Lido receive the WETH directly from your **contract**, not your wallet.

3. If you then unwind or mint another token (like `stETH` or `weETH`), your contract can use that output to:

   * repay Morpho,
   * or perform another operation (swap, deposit as collateral, etc.),
   * as long as by the end of the same transaction the borrowed amount (plus fee) is **back in Morpho’s pool**.

4. If any step fails or doesn’t return the exact amount, the **entire tx reverts**, so Morpho is never at risk.

### 🧩 4. Key takeaway

| Step              | Description                                    | Token Location                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Flash loan starts | Morpho sends WETH                              | To **your contract**, not wallet     |
| You stake         | Your contract approves and calls Lido/Ether.Fi | From your contract                   |
| Loan repayment    | Your contract repays Morpho                    | From your contract                   |
| Tx completes      | All balances settle                            | No residuals (if designed correctly) |

---

### ✅ 5. Summary

* The funds **don’t need to touch your wallet** (and shouldn’t — that’d break atomicity).
* You orchestrate everything via a **smart contract that Morpho calls as flash-loan receiver**.
* That contract can directly call **Lido, Ether.Fi, or any other protocol** within the same transaction.
* The entire process is atomic — if repayment fails, all actions revert.

If you’d like, I can show you a **minimal Solidity snippet** of a Morpho flash-loan receiver that stakes into Lido or Ether.Fi within the same transaction, to illustrate how the flow actually looks in code. Would you like that?
