# Basis Strategy - DeFi Strategy Platform üöÄ

## üíº **Business Overview**

**Live and backtesting framework for multi-strategy yield generation** through staking, lending, and funding rate arbitrage across web3 and CEX platforms.

### **Product Model**
- **Share Classes**: Clients invest in USDT or ETH share classes
- **Yield Strategies**: Staking rewards + funding rate arbitrage with optional leverage
- **Dynamic Rebalancing**: Maximum capital allocation minus withdrawal buffer
- **Fully Automated**: Complete web UI with monitoring and control

### **Similar To**: Ethena, but enhanced with:
- Multiple share classes (USDT/ETH)
- Dynamic capital rebalancing
- Multiple strategy modes per share class
- Advanced cross-venue optimization

### **Development Phases**
1. **Phase 1** (Current): Major refactor for local deployment and improved architecture
2. **Phase 2**: 100% working, tested, deployed backtesting system for defi and basis trading
3. **Phase 3**: E2E simulation in dev environment with no capital for defi and basis trading
4. **Phase 4**: Integration of ML directional data provider and ML directional strategy manager into the backtesting system
5. **Phase 5**: Integration of ML directional data provider and ML directional strategy manager into the live trading system dev environment with no capital
6. **Phase 6**: E2E simulation in staging with small capital for defi and basis trading
7. **Phase 7**: E2E simulation in staging environment with small capital for ML directional trading
8. **Phase 8**: Live trading with full capital deployment for ML directional trading
9. **Phase 9**: Live trading with full capital deployment for defi and basis trading


### **Quality Standards**
- **80% minimum** unit test coverage per task
- **80% target** unit and integration test coverage overall
- **100% target** e2e test coverage
- **Audit-grade** logging and reconciliation
- **Centralized Testing**: All tests orchestrated through `run_quality_gates.py`
- **Platform Commands**: Dedicated test commands for different areas

## üß™ **Testing System**

### **Test Organization (January 2025)**
The test system has been completely restructured for better maintainability:

#### **New Directory Structure**
```
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/          # EventDrivenStrategyEngine components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ calculators/         # Math and calculation components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/               # Data-related components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ engines/            # Engine components
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pricing/            # Pricing components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/            # Integration tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ e2e/                   # End-to-end tests
```

#### **Platform Commands**
```bash
# Test specific areas
./platform.sh config-test     # Configuration validation
./platform.sh data-test       # Data validation
./platform.sh workflow-test   # Workflow integration
./platform.sh component-test  # Component architecture
./platform.sh e2e-test        # End-to-end testing

# Run comprehensive tests
./platform.sh test            # All quality gates
```

### **Centralized Orchestration**
All tests are now orchestrated through `run_quality_gates.py`:
- **Single Entry Point**: All quality gates run through one script
- **Category-Based**: Tests organized by functional area
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Uniform error reporting across all tests
- **Maintainable**: Changes to test structure only need updates in one place

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

### **Component-Based Service Architecture**
- **9 Core Components** - Modular, testable, maintainable
- **6 Strategy Modes** - Pure lending, BTC basis, ETH leveraged, ETH staking only, USDT market neutral, USDT market neutral no leverage

- **Audit-Grade Logging** - Complete event trail and reconciliation
- **Common Architecture** - Shared codebase for backtest and live modes
- **Mode-Specific Execution** - Backtest uses simulations, live uses real APIs

### **Technology Stack**
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Pandas
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Plotly
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Google Cloud Platform
- **Testing**: pytest, comprehensive test coverage
